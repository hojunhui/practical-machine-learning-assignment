The purpose of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict the manner in which they did the exercise., as indicated by the class variable They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

A prediction model based on gradient boosting was built based on training data and its performance was evaluated using test data.

```{r}
# Import data
train.data <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
test.data <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

# Build models based on training data
# Load caret package
library(caret)

# Train data based on gradient boosting model
index <- which(is.na(train.data[1,]))
fit <- train(classe ~ ., data = train.data[,-index], method = "gbm")
fit

# Predict class variable based on model
predictions <- predict(fit, newdata = test.data[,-c(1:7)],na.rm=TRUE)
predictions
